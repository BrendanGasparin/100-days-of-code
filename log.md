# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 25: July 6, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my list of cybersecurity resources with cybersecurity and ethical hacking certifications.  

**Thoughts:** Sort of cheating by doing Markdown two days in a row, but I couldn't think of anything else to do and it's a Saturday, so whatevs.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Cybersecurity Resource List](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-cybersecurity-resources)  


### Day 24: July 5, 2024  

**Today's Progress:** Updated my profile, cybersecurity, and hacking lists. Markdown count as code!  

**Thoughts:** It feels like a bit of a cop-out to just do Markdown for my hour of code, but I can hardly call my lists "curated" if I don't actively curate them.

### Day 23: July 4, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my list of cybersecurity resources with CTF sites and bug bounty platforms.  

**Thoughts:** Missed my hour of code yesterday. I have to be more vigilant in ensuring I do it every day. Perhaps I should do it in the morning instead of at night? The cybersecurity resources list is far from complete but is starting to get pretty long. I need to research whether it's possible to include a table of contents at the top linking to the various sections.

### Day 22: July 2, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Implemented ROT decryption in JavaScript Cryptography website. Added an error box to tell the user if they failed to select an algorithm. Updated my cybersecurity resource list with a few YouTube channels. Updated my Github profile, replacing my old ROT-13 website with JavaScript Cryptography in my Cybersecurity Projects list.  

**Thoughts:** Next I will implement a substitution cipher for JavaScript cryptography. I am unsure whether or not to include CTF games in my cybersecurity resources list, or just have them in my hacking list. Probably both.

### Day 21: July 1, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Followed a Tiff in Tech [YouTube tutorial on building a file organizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7e5-n9FuXU). Modified it to make it move the files to a directory in my OneDrive.  

**Thoughts:** Interesting to see the power of Python at work in file management. In the future I want to modify this script to allow the user to specify source and destination directories.

### Day 20: June 30, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Added a start screen to the dinosaur game and looped the game over screen to it, so the player can restart the game without reloading the browser window.  

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble getting this to work and had to rely on ChatGPT to find a persistent bug for me. I need to brush up on my JavaScript through freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project. I still need to add increasing difficulty to this project.

### Day 19: June 29, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my cybersecurity resources list.  

**Thoughts:** I need to add CTFs.

### Day 18: June 28, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Completed the T-Rex run tutorial, and modified the speed and physics.  

**Thoughts:** I want to modify the game more. My son says the original version increases in difficulty as you play. I could also modify the graphics and add a scoring or timer system or both.

### Day 17: June 27, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Began Ania Kubow's [T-Rex Run YouTube tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OnkimGiEkb4).

**Thoughts:** It's very cool that you can animate a scrolling background using only CSS. I know we're supposed to work on our own projects and not tutorials for 100 Days of Code but when I've finished the tutorial I will add functionality and features so I think it's okay in this instance.

### Day 16: June 26, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Implemented ROT encryption in my JavaScript Cryptography site.

**Thoughts:** I spent half an hour on top of the hour of code tracking down a bug in my code. I was taking the user input for the ROT number as a string when I needed to parse it into an int. I have to implement an error message when the user tries to encrypt without selecting an algorithm. Then I will implement ROT decryption.

### Day 15: June 25, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the UI of the cryptography website. If you select the ROT cipher now then a second dropdown appears to allow you to set the number of characters to shift.

**Thoughts:** I should be ready to implement the ROT cipher on day 16.

### Day 14: June 24, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Started a cryptography website. Made a simple UI with HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's getting harder to think of new projects to keep me busy during the 100 days of code challenge.

### Day 13: June 23, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my Github profile with a cybersecurity project section containing my PHP login system, password generators, Google home page mockup, and ROT-13 cipher.  

**Thoughts:** I need more cybersecurity-based projects to pad out that section of my portfolio.

### Day 12: June 22, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Made a strong password generator in JavaScript where you can copy the generated password to your clipboard.

**Thoughts:** Got my mother to use the app and she didn't understand how many digits to put in for the password length. Not sure if my UI is unclear or if she was just having a boomer moment. Maybe test with other people?

### Day 11: June 21, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Made CS50 homepage assignment responsive on both mobile and desktop and submitted it.

**Thoughts:** The project could be better, but it's a simple task for one week of the course and I want to move on with the rest of the course content.

### Day 10: June 20, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Worked to make portfolio.html of the CS50 homepage assignment responsive on mobile.

**Thoughts:** Forgot to update the Github log for 4 days and did it retro-actively. Must update it every day.

### Day 6: June 15, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Created a portfolio page for my CS50 homepage assignment.  

**Thoughts:** Included the HTML for title, blurb, and image for each project. But they don't link anywhere. TODO: Add links.

### Day 5: June 14, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Converted CS50 homepage CSS colours into Bootstrap colours and gradients.  

**Thoughts:** One of the criteria of this assignment is to use Bootstrap in some way, so I integrated Bootstrap colours and gradients into the website.

### Day 4: June 13, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Styled my CS50 homepage and implemented a random quote generator using JavaScript.  

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript is a bit rusty and I need to practice it, but I am going to concentrate on finishing CS50 before I brush up on JS using freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project.

### Day 3: June 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Designed home page for CS50 project.  

**Thoughts:** We're supposed to do our own projects for 100 Days of Code but I need to finish the CS50 course so this project will do. I can't make the code public because of academic integrity but I can reuse parts of it. I plan to add a random quote generator tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooted my inability to fork the 100 days of code repository. Wrote this log. Updated my cybersecurity resources list.  

**Thoughts:** I could not fork the 100 days of code log repository again after having forked it once before. Instead I cloned it and hooked it to a new remote repository on Github. This took me quite some time as I kept trying to push it via HTTPS, when I should have been pushing via SSH.

### Day 1: June 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated cybersecurity resources repository on Github. Attempted unsuccessfully to fork the 100 days of code log.  

**Thoughts:** Markdown counts as code! So updating my cybersecurity resources list counts as code too. I was unable to fork the 100 days of code log because I have already forked it before.
