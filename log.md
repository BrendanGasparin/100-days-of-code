# 100 Days Of Code - Log - r1 2025  


### Day 15: Thursday 12th June, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Completed filter-less exercise from CS50x week 4 problem set.  

**Thoughts:** I haven't posted on X or updated my log since day 9, 4th June, but I coded for at least an hour every day except Monday 9th June. Will start posting on social media again today. It's difficult, because I can't post code samples without breaking Harvard's academic integrity policy, but I'll still try, as posting is part of the challenge.

### Day 9: Wednesday 4th June, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Completed Substitution exercise from CS50x week 2 problem set.

### Day 8: Tuesday 3rd June, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Completed Scrabble, Readability, and Caesar exercises from CS50x week 2 problem set.

1. N/A  


### Day 7: Monday 2nd June, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Completed Credit exercise from CS50x week 1 problem set.  

**Thoughts:** It's kind of boring doing exercises that I have done repeatedly for the last several years. I want to finish CS50x as quickly as possible so I can check a box and get on with my own projects.  

**Link(s) to work:**  
1. N/A  


### Day 6: Sunday 1st June, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Watched CS50's week 1 lecture on C programming and completed the exercises: Hello World, Hello Me, Mario Less, Mario More, and Cash.  

**Thoughts:** I will complete the Credit exercise tomorrow. It sort of sucks that I can't link my CS50 source code in this log, but that would be against academic integrity policies.

1. N/A  


### Day 5: Saturday May 31, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Created logic to increase the spawn rate of asteroids as time progresses in the game. This is my last day of week 0 of CS50x so I packaged the game up and submitted it to the course.   

**Thoughts:** I should continue to work on the game throughout the year to improve it.

2. [Invaders of Uranus Asteroid Shooter 2](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1183050311/)  


### Day 4: May 30, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Doubled the speed of the Invaders of Uranus game in response to user feedback on X/Twitter. Fixed an issue where some explosions did not decrease their Y position. Made a randomly generated starscape in the background. I also made other cosmetic changes, like pixelating most of the graphics and adding a little astronaut dude on the title screen.  

**Thoughts:** I need to add another enemy, or there aren't really any invaders of Uranus, just asteroids.

2. [Invaders of Uranus Random Starscape](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1182610679/)  


### Day 3: May 29, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Added explosions to the asteroids and ship in Invaders of Uranus. Added a simple scoring system: 1 point per asteroid shot.  

**Thoughts:** An X user commented that the game felt slow. I should fix this sooner rather than later, probably with a variable I can change.  

I can't seem to figure out how to despawn the bullets and the asteroid at the same time. Maybe wait 0.1 seconds after the impact so both objects have time to detect the collision and despawn?

2. [Invaders of Uranus Movement and Shooting](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1181238890/)  



### Day 2: May 28, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Added asteroids to Invaders of Uranus, which can be destroyed by the ship's bullets, but which can also destroy the ship if they collide with it.  

**Thoughts:** I need to add little explosions for when things get destroyed.

### Day 1: May 27, 2025  

**Today's progress:** Worked on a Scratch video game: Invaders of Uranus. Created a player character with movement controls and the ability to fire bullets.  

**Thoughts:** I want to finally complete CS50x this year. Starting with a Scratch game.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log - r1 2024

### Day 30: July 11, 2024  

**Today's progress:** Added random quote generator to Github home page, and some sales copy.

**Thoughts:** This rebuilding-my-Github-homepage is taking a lot longer than I thought. The last one was pretty dated though, so any work I do is just gravy.  

**Link(s) to work:**  
1. [Brendan's Github Homepage](https://brendangasparin.github.io)  


### Day 29: July 10, 2024  

**Today's progress:** Rebuilding my Github home page.  

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how little progress I made in one hour. I'm rebuilding my Github homepage as the old one is dated, not responsive on mobile, doesn't follow best practices, and is missing some of my more recent projects.  

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Brendan's Github Homepage](https://brendangasparin.github.io)  


### Day 28: July 9, 2024

**Today's progress:** Modified cryptography site. Added labels to the UI elements, made website responsive on both mobile and larger screens, and added descriptions for each type of cipher.  

**Thoughts:** Not much to do here now except add more encryption algorithms.  

**Link(s) to work:**  
1. [JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/)  


### Day 27: July 8, 2024

**Today's progress:** Added substitution cipher decryption to JavaScript cryptography page. Updated the description on my Github profile and updated the description of some of my other projects on there too.  

**Thoughtss:** For JS Cryptography, I still need to add labels to the fields, clipboard copy buttons for mobile users, and I should tighten up the UI and make it more responsive between desktop and mobile devices.  

**Link(s) to work:**  
1. [JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/)  


### Day 26: July 7, 2024  

**Today's Progress:** Added substitution cipher encryption to JavaScript Cryptography page.  

**Thoughts:** I need to add labels to the plaintext, ciphertext, and ciphers. I also need to add substitution cipher encryption, and clipboard copy buttons for mobile phone users.  

**Link(s) to work:**  
1. [JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/)  


### Day 25: July 6, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my list of cybersecurity resources with cybersecurity and ethical hacking certifications.  

**Thoughts:** Sort of cheating by doing Markdown two days in a row, but I couldn't think of anything else to do and it's a Saturday, so whatevs.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Cybersecurity Resource List](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-cybersecurity-resources)  


### Day 24: July 5, 2024  

**Today's Progress:** Updated my profile, cybersecurity, and hacking lists. Markdown count as code!  

**Thoughts:** It feels like a bit of a cop-out to just do Markdown for my hour of code, but I can hardly call my lists "curated" if I don't actively curate them.

2. [Cybersecurity Resource List](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-cybersecurity-resources)  
3. [Hacking Resource List](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-hacking-resources)  


### Day 23: July 4, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my list of cybersecurity resources with CTF sites and bug bounty platforms.  

**Thoughts:** Missed my hour of code yesterday. I have to be more vigilant in ensuring I do it every day. Perhaps I should do it in the morning instead of at night? The cybersecurity resources list is far from complete but is starting to get pretty long. I need to research whether it's possible to include a table of contents at the top linking to the various sections.

1. [Cybersecurity Resource List](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-cybersecurity-resources)  


### Day 22: July 2, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Implemented ROT decryption in JavaScript Cryptography website. Added an error box to tell the user if they failed to select an algorithm. Updated my cybersecurity resource list with a few YouTube channels. Updated my Github profile, replacing my old ROT-13 website with JavaScript Cryptography in my Cybersecurity Projects list.  

**Thoughts:** Next I will implement a substitution cipher for JavaScript cryptography. I am unsure whether or not to include CTF games in my cybersecurity resources list, or just have them in my hacking list. Probably both.

### Day 21: July 1, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Followed a Tiff in Tech [YouTube tutorial on building a file organizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7e5-n9FuXU). Modified it to make it move the files to a directory in my OneDrive.  

**Thoughts:** Interesting to see the power of Python at work in file management. In the future I want to modify this script to allow the user to specify source and destination directories.

1. [Desktop Organizer](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/py-desktop-organizer)


### Day 20: June 30, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Added a start screen to the dinosaur game and looped the game over screen to it, so the player can restart the game without reloading the browser window.  

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble getting this to work and had to rely on ChatGPT to find a persistent bug for me. I need to brush up on my JavaScript through freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project. I still need to add increasing difficulty to this project.

1. [Dinosaur Run](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-dinosaur-run/)  


### Day 19: June 29, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my cybersecurity resources list.  

**Thoughts:** I need to add CTFs.  

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Cybersecurity Resource List](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-cybersecurity-resources)  


### Day 18: June 28, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Completed the T-Rex run tutorial, and modified the speed and physics.  

**Thoughts:** I want to modify the game more. My son says the original version increases in difficulty as you play. I could also modify the graphics and add a scoring or timer system or both.  

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Dinosaur Run](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-dinosaur-run/)


### Day 17: June 27, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Began Ania Kubow's [T-Rex Run YouTube tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OnkimGiEkb4).

**Thoughts:** It's very cool that you can animate a scrolling background using only CSS. I know we're supposed to work on our own projects and not tutorials for 100 Days of Code but when I've finished the tutorial I will add functionality and features so I think it's okay in this instance.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Dinosaur Run](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-dinosaur-run/)


### Day 16: June 26, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Implemented ROT encryption in my JavaScript Cryptography site.

**Thoughts:** I spent half an hour on top of the hour of code tracking down a bug in my code. I was taking the user input for the ROT number as a string when I needed to parse it into an int. I have to implement an error message when the user tries to encrypt without selecting an algorithm. Then I will implement ROT decryption.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/)


### Day 15: June 25, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the UI of the cryptography website. If you select the ROT cipher now then a second dropdown appears to allow you to set the number of characters to shift.

**Thoughts:** I should be ready to implement the ROT cipher on day 16.

1. [JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/)


### Day 14: June 24, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Started a cryptography website. Made a simple UI with HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's getting harder to think of new projects to keep me busy during the 100 days of code challenge.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/)


### Day 13: June 23, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my Github profile with a cybersecurity project section containing my PHP login system, password generators, Google home page mockup, and ROT-13 cipher.  

**Thoughts:** I need more cybersecurity-based projects to pad out that section of my portfolio.  

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Github profile](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/)  


### Day 12: June 22, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Made a strong password generator in JavaScript where you can copy the generated password to your clipboard.

**Thoughts:** Got my mother to use the app and she didn't understand how many digits to put in for the password length. Not sure if my UI is unclear or if she was just having a boomer moment. Maybe test with other people?

### Day 11: June 21, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Made CS50 homepage assignment responsive on both mobile and desktop and submitted it.

**Thoughts:** The project could be better, but it's a simple task for one week of the course and I want to move on with the rest of the course content.

### Day 10: June 20, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Worked to make portfolio.html of the CS50 homepage assignment responsive on mobile.

**Thoughts:** Forgot to update the Github log for 4 days and did it retro-actively. Must update it every day.

### Day 6: June 15, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Created a portfolio page for my CS50 homepage assignment.  

**Thoughts:** Included the HTML for title, blurb, and image for each project. But they don't link anywhere. TODO: Add links.

### Day 5: June 14, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Converted CS50 homepage CSS colours into Bootstrap colours and gradients.  

**Thoughts:** One of the criteria of this assignment is to use Bootstrap in some way, so I integrated Bootstrap colours and gradients into the website.

### Day 4: June 13, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Styled my CS50 homepage and implemented a random quote generator using JavaScript.  

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript is a bit rusty and I need to practice it, but I am going to concentrate on finishing CS50 before I brush up on JS using freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project.

### Day 3: June 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Designed home page for CS50 project.  

**Thoughts:** We're supposed to do our own projects for 100 Days of Code but I need to finish the CS50 course so this project will do. I can't make the code public because of academic integrity but I can reuse parts of it. I plan to add a random quote generator tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooted my inability to fork the 100 days of code repository. Wrote this log. Updated my cybersecurity resources list.  

**Thoughts:** I could not fork the 100 days of code log repository again after having forked it once before. Instead I cloned it and hooked it to a new remote repository on Github. This took me quite some time as I kept trying to push it via HTTPS, when I should have been pushing via SSH.

### Day 1: June 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated cybersecurity resources repository on Github. Attempted unsuccessfully to fork the 100 days of code log.  

**Thoughts:** Markdown counts as code! So updating my cybersecurity resources list counts as code too. I was unable to fork the 100 days of code log because I have already forked it before.
