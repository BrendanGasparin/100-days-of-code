# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 17: June 27, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Began Ania Kubow's [T-Rex Run YouTube tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OnkimGiEkb4).

**Thoughts:** It's very cool that you can animate a scrolling background using only CSS. I know we're supposed to work on our own projects and not tutorials for 100 Days of Code but when I've finished the tutorial I will add functionality and features so I think it's okay in this instance.

### Day 16: June 26, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Implemented ROT encryption in my JavaScript Cryptography site.

**Thoughts:** I spent half an hour on top of the hour of code tracking down a bug in my code. I was taking the user input for the ROT number as a string when I needed to parse it into an int. I have to implement an error message when the user tries to encrypt without selecting an algorithm. Then I will implement ROT decryption.

### Day 15: June 25, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the UI of the cryptography website. If you select the ROT cipher now then a second dropdown appears to allow you to set the number of characters to shift.

**Thoughts:** I should be ready to implement the ROT cipher on day 16.

### Day 14: June 24, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Started a cryptography website. Made a simple UI with HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's getting harder to think of new projects to keep me busy during the 100 days of code challenge.

### Day 13: June 23, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated my Github profile with a cybersecurity project section containing my PHP login system, password generators, Google home page mockup, and ROT-13 cipher.  

**Thoughts:** I need more cybersecurity-based projects to pad out that section of my portfolio.

### Day 12: June 22, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Made a strong password generator in JavaScript where you can copy the generated password to your clipboard.

**Thoughts:** Got my mother to use the app and she didn't understand how many digits to put in for the password length. Not sure if my UI is unclear or if she was just having a boomer moment. Maybe test with other people?

### Day 11: June 21, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Made CS50 homepage assignment responsive on both mobile and desktop and submitted it.

**Thoughts:** The project could be better, but it's a simple task for one week of the course and I want to move on with the rest of the course content.

### Day 10: June 20, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Worked to make portfolio.html of the CS50 homepage assignment responsive on mobile.

**Thoughts:** Forgot to update the Github log for 4 days and did it retro-actively. Must update it every day.

### Day 6: June 15, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Created a portfolio page for my CS50 homepage assignment.  

**Thoughts:** Included the HTML for title, blurb, and image for each project. But they don't link anywhere. TODO: Add links.

### Day 5: June 14, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Converted CS50 homepage CSS colours into Bootstrap colours and gradients.  

**Thoughts:** One of the criteria of this assignment is to use Bootstrap in some way, so I integrated Bootstrap colours and gradients into the website.

### Day 4: June 13, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Styled my CS50 homepage and implemented a random quote generator using JavaScript.  

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript is a bit rusty and I need to practice it, but I am going to concentrate on finishing CS50 before I brush up on JS using freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project.

### Day 3: June 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Designed home page for CS50 project.  

**Thoughts:** We're supposed to do our own projects for 100 Days of Code but I need to finish the CS50 course so this project will do. I can't make the code public because of academic integrity but I can reuse parts of it. I plan to add a random quote generator tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooted my inability to fork the 100 days of code repository. Wrote this log. Updated my cybersecurity resources list.  

**Thoughts:** I could not fork the 100 days of code log repository again after having forked it once before. Instead I cloned it and hooked it to a new remote repository on Github. This took me quite some time as I kept trying to push it via HTTPS, when I should have been pushing via SSH.

### Day 1: June 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated cybersecurity resources repository on Github. Attempted unsuccessfully to fork the 100 days of code log.  

**Thoughts:** Markdown counts as code! So updating my cybersecurity resources list counts as code too. I was unable to fork the 100 days of code log because I have already forked it before.
