# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: June 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Designed home page for CS50 project.  

**Thoughts:** We're supposed to do our own projects for 100 Days of Code but I need to finish the CS50 course so this project will do. I can't make the code public because of academic integrity but I can reuse parts of it. I plan to add a random quote generator tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooted my inability to fork the 100 days of code repository. Wrote this log. Updated my cybersecurity resources list.  

**Thoughts:** I could not fork the 100 days of code log repository again after having forked it once before. Instead I cloned it and hooked it to a new remote repository on Github. This took me quite some time as I kept trying to push it via HTTPS, when I should have been pushing via SSH.

### Day 1: June 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Updated cybersecurity resources repository on Github. Attempted unsuccessfully to fork the 100 days of code log.  

**Thoughts:** Markdown counts as code! So updating my cybersecurity resources list counts as code too. I was unable to fork the 100 days of code log because I have already forked it before.
